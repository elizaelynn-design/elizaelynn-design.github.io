            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Knowing the domain weightings helps you allocate study time effectively.</p>

        <h2>2. Focus on Key AWS Services</h2>
        <p>The exam tests your ability to use AWS ML services in real-world scenarios. Focus on mastering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Amazon SageMaker – Training, tuning, and deploying models</li>
            <li>AWS Glue – Data preparation and ETL</li>
            <li>AWS Lambda – Automating ML workflows</li>
            <li>Amazon S3 – Storage for datasets and artefacts</li>
            <li>CloudWatch / Step Functions – Monitoring and orchestration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hands-on experience with these services is critical for success.</p>

        <h2>3. Take Practice Questions</h2>
        <p>One of the best ways to prepare is to practice with real exam-style questions. Doing so helps you understand the question format, difficulty level, and scenario-based problems. You can start with free MLA-C01 practice questions here: <a href="https://www.study4exam.com/amazon/free-mla-c01-questions" target="_blank">AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate Exam – Free Questions</a>.</p>
        <p>Regular practice will build confidence and help you identify areas that need more focus.</p>

        <h2>4. Build a Study Plan</h2>
        <p>Create a structured study plan based on exam domains. Include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily hands-on exercises on SageMaker or other AWS services</li>
            <li>Weekly revision of important ML concepts and AWS best practices</li>
            <li>Practice test sessions to simulate real exam conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consistency is more important than cramming — allocate enough time for understanding and practice.</p>

        <h2>5. Key Tips for Exam Day</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Read questions carefully, especially scenario-based ones</li>
            <li>Manage your time efficiently (roughly 2–3 minutes per question)</li>
            <li>Review your answers if time permits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By following a structured approach and practising regularly, passing the <span class="highlight">AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate Exam (MLA-C01)</span> in 2026 is achievable.</p>
