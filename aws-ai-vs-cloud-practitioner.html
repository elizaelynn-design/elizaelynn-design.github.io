    <h1>AWS Certified AI Practitioner vs Cloud Practitioner</h1>
    <p>If you're starting your AWS certification journey, two entry-level options stand out: the <strong>AWS Certified AI Practitioner</strong> and the <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong>. While both are beginner-friendly, they serve different goals. This guide compares them side-by-side to help you choose the right path.</p>

    <h2>What Is the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)</strong> exam is ideal for those new to cloud computing. It covers AWS fundamentals, billing, security, and architecture basics. You don’t need a technical background, making it perfect for business professionals, students, and anyone exploring cloud careers.</p>

    <h3>Key Topics:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS global infrastructure</li>
      <li>Cloud economics and billing</li>
      <li>Security and compliance</li>
      <li>Basic architectural principles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Is the AWS Certified AI Practitioner?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)</strong> exam is designed for those interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence on AWS. It’s more technical and focuses on AWS AI services like SageMaker, Rekognition, and Comprehend. If you're aiming for AI roles or want hands-on experience with ML workflows, this is the better fit.</p>

    <h3>Key Topics:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Machine learning lifecycle</li>
      <li>Model training and deployment</li>
      <li>Bias mitigation and ethical AI</li>
      <li>Hands-on with AWS AI services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Resources</h2>
    <p>To prepare effectively, practice exams are essential. For AI Practitioner, check out this detailed comparison and resource guide:</p>

    <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
    <p>Choose <strong>Cloud Practitioner</strong> if you want a broad understanding of AWS and cloud fundamentals. Choose <strong>AI Practitioner</strong> if you're focused on machine learning, AI services, and technical implementation. Both certifications are valuable — your career goals should guide your choice.</p>

    <p><em>Tip: After passing the AI Practitioner exam, consider sharing your score and prep strategy to help others — just like I did when I scored 80%!</em></p>
